# MC TOOLS E-Commerce Application

This is an e-commerce application for selling mobile repairing tools and parts, built with Angular, Tailwind CSS, and PrimeNG.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Color Theme

This application uses a custom color theme with the following palette:

- **Deep Cobalt** (#0047AB) - Primary brand color
- **Electric Orange** (#FF6600) - Accent/CTA color
- **Soft Light Gray** (#F8F8F8) - Background/light elements
- **Near Black** (#212121) - Text/dark elements
- **Emerald Green** (#28A745) - Success/positive actions
- **Crimson Red** (#DC3545) - Error/negative actions

See `COLOR_THEME.md` for detailed implementation information.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
